            <p id="two"><br> With the Type 55 Super Sport, BUGATTI reinvented the Grand Tourisme, combining for the first time thoroughbred racing car technology with the comfort and luxury of a touring car. Fitted with a supercharger, the 2.3-liter in-line-eight-cylinder engine delivered over 160 PS and vigorous torque to accelerate the two-seater well beyond 180 km/h (112 mph). <br> <br> </p>
            <p id="three"><b>"BUGATTI raised performance and comfort to a whole new level in the early 30s, creating a new vehicle concept. This car was way ahead of its time in terms of sheer performance and speed, but also for its comfort and uncomplicated drivability,</b>" says Luigi Galli, head of Heritage at BUGATTI.</p>

            <p id="two"><br> Direct, agile, light, and tremendously fast. Presented 30 years ago, the EB 110 Super Sport was in a whole new league. A superb V12 made of aluminum and magnesium, with 60 valves, 4 turbos, 610 PS mated to a six-speed manual and permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. More figures? 351 km/h, 3.26 seconds for the 0-100 km/h, 296 km/h on ice… <br><br></p>
            <p id="three"><b>"I'm amazed at how modern the EB 110 SS still drives today. The chassis is agile, the steering direct, yet it offers plenty of comfort even for longer distances. Despite the immense power of over 600 PS, the control and balance of the EB 110 is excellent... Developing the EB 110 was the best time of my life”</b>, says Loris Bicocchi, who developed the EB 110 from scratch in the late 80s and early 90s.</p>

        <p id="two"><br>The Veyron heralds a new era into the next millennium and catapults sports cars into another dimension. In 2010, the 16.4 Super Sport achieved what seemed unthinkable at the time: increase power to a staggering 1.200 PS, enabling the coupé to accelerate from a standstill to 200 km/h (124 mph) in just 6.7 seconds, and to set a new world record of 431 km/h (268 mph). Only 450 Veyron were built in Molsheim until 2015, including 48 16.4 Super Sport. <br><br></p>
        <p id="three"><b>"It's an extraordinary vehicle. In addition to its incredible power delivery, its perfection lies in its easy drivability and high-quality finish,"</b> enthuses the world-record holder Pierre-Henri Raphanel, BUGATTI Pilote Officiel. <br>

            <b>"I will always associate the Veyron Super Sport with a very special moment in my life. I remember that I didn't sleep well the night before my record-drive. But when I woke up at 4:27 a.m., I took that as a sign... and the rest is history."</b></p>
